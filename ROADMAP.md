# Mokuri — Roadmap

## Completed: Quality & Creativity Improvements (Phases 1–5)

### Phase 1 — Background & Atmosphere ✅
Added sky (6 types: dawn, day, dusk, night, overcast), ground (6 types: earth, grass, snow, sand, water), horizon slider (20–85%), and 0–3 mist bands. Organic wobble edges, not hard lines. Renders in both workspace and print output. Biggest single impact — compositions went from floating objects on blank paper to scenes with depth and mood.

### Phase 2 — Element Library Expansion ✅
Added `scene-elements.js` with 11 new elements: bamboo grove, rock formation, temple roof, distant village, stone path, wooden bridge, rain curtain, snowfall, cloud wisp, maple branch, iris cluster. Total library grew from ~25 to ~36 elements across 4 files.

### Phase 3 — Procedural Variation ✅
Each element instance gets a `variationSeed` (mulberry32 PRNG) that subtly perturbs SVG paths, with amount scaling by carve level. Two copies of the same element now look slightly different — kills the digital copy-paste feel.

### Phase 4 — Scene Presets ✅
6 curated starting compositions accessible from the file menu: Mountain Dawn, Garden Pond, Ocean Night, Snow Village, Bamboo Forest, Autumn Valley. Each sets palette, atmosphere, paper type, and places elements with intentional carve levels and scales.

### Phase 5 — Ink Absorption ✅
Ink absorption variation in print engine post-processing — subtle per-region opacity variation so large inked areas don't look perfectly uniform, mimicking how paper absorbs ink unevenly.

---

### Phase 6 — Carving Experience ✅
Four features deepening the carving workflow:
- **Carve Focus Mode**: F key or Focus button zooms smoothly into a selected element with floating toolbar. Dimmed non-focused elements. Escape exits. Smooth viewBox animation.
- **Carve Pattern Fills**: 6 patterns (crosshatch, woodgrain, diagonal, stipple, wave) replace flat paper reveals on carved areas. Per-element `el.carvePattern`, renders in both workspace and print.
- **Background Carving**: Paper background is now carveable. Click empty space in carve mode to carve the paper itself. Strokes render between atmosphere and elements.
- **Hanko Stamps**: 6 pre-made seal shapes (circle, square, gourd, oval, diamond, cloud) + custom initials generator (1–3 characters → procedural brush-stroke seal). Hanko elements get reduced misregistration in print.

### Phase 7 — Carve Tool Naturalness ✅
Three tiers of pen input and rendering improvements:
- **Input smoothing**: EMA filter on position/pressure/tilt, coalesced pointer events for full digitizer resolution (~240Hz on Surface Pen).
- **Catmull-Rom curves**: Replaced polyline rendering (M L L L) with smooth cubic Bezier curves through all stroke points.
- **Variable-width pressure ribbons**: Per-point pressure maps to ribbon width via filled path outlines (not constant-width strokes). Entry/exit taper, organic noise.
- **Tilt-based gouge asymmetry**: Pen tilt shifts ribbon half-widths for calligraphic variation (V-gouge: 0.5, U-gouge: 0.35).
- **Pressure curve presets**: Soft/Medium/Firm configurable response curves in Carving Workbench.
- **Print fidelity**: Fiber ghosts in shallow cuts, ink edge pooling on deep cuts, pressure-dependent edge noise, tilt feathering on shallow wall side.

### Phase 8 — Paper Type Expansion ✅
Three new papers added (total: 6):
- **Gampi** (雁皮) — ultra-smooth, cool-toned, luminous. Cleanest prints.
- **Unryu** (雲龍) — dramatic long sweeping fibers via quadratic curves.
- **Kakishibu** (柿渋) — persimmon-tanned warm brown. Unique darker aesthetic.
Paper selector updated to 3-column grid. Print engine now uses actual paper base color for carve grooves (not hardcoded).

---

### Phase 10 — Interaction Polish ✅
- **Resize cursor fix**: Directional arrow cursor now stays visible throughout resize drag (previously reverted to crosshair mid-drag).
- **Anchor-based resize**: Opposite corner/edge stays pinned during resize for true 1:1 pointer-to-handle tracking. Rotation-aware — projects pointer deltas into element's local coordinate frame.
- **Move dead zone**: 6px screen-pixel threshold before element move commits, preventing accidental displacement during select/tap with pen and touch.
- **Multi-selection**: Ctrl/Cmd+click for additive selection. Group operations: move, delete, flip, duplicate, lock/unlock, layer reorder all work on full selection set. Ctrl+A selects all. Per-element dashed bounding boxes in multi-select mode. Carve/ink workbenches show "N elements selected" message; carve focus requires single selection.

### Phase 10.5 — UI Refinement & Authentic Print Process ✅
- **Kanji toolbar icons**: Replaced colorful emoji with muted kanji characters — 景 Compose, 彫 Carve, 墨 Ink, 摺 Make Print, 帖 Gallery — each in a distinct earth-tone color for visual association (ochre, wood, indigo, brick, sage).
- **About/Makimono refresh**: Inline kanji+label layout, colored step names, accurate feature descriptions reflecting full app capabilities (10 palettes, 6 papers, 3 gouges, carve patterns, hanko seals, atmosphere, scene presets).
- **Baren burnishing animation**: Replaced Western roller with authentic circular baren (馬連) — bamboo-sheath radial gradient with conic coil pattern, sweeping arcs with circular sub-motions, alternating direction per pass. Three synchronized sound moments: paper lay (thud + rustle), baren friction (rhythmic bandpass noise), paper peel (noise sweep).
- **Paper texture in animation**: Animation sheet generates canvas-based paper texture matching the print engine's `drawPaperTexture` — fiber bundles, fine fibers, warm patches, and Unryu's long dramatic fibers all visible during the paper lay-down.
- **Baren passes** (renamed from "Impressions"): Multi-pass offset reduced from ±1.2px to ±0.3px, opacity retuned (0.92/0.35) — richer ink depth without blur. UI label updated to "Baren Passes."
- **Print studio no light dismiss**: Requires explicit close (P key, Escape, Back to Edit, or switching workbench) — prevents accidental print loss.

---

### Phase 11A: Pattern Carving Enhancements ✅ (Partial — Core Complete)

Density and rotation controls, freehand pattern tool, and UX polish shipped. Per-zone patterns and library expansion deferred.

- **Pattern density slider**: Sparse→dense tonal control in Carving Workbench. Stored per-element in save data.
- **Pattern rotation**: 0°/45°/90° angle control for directional patterns. Persisted in localStorage.
- **Freehand pattern tool**: New "pattern" carve tool — paint pattern fills along brush strokes. Uses existing pressure/tilt pipeline with pattern fill instead of solid cut. Strokes store pattern, density, and rotation per-stroke.
- **Pattern tool pressure control**: Continuous pressure slider applies to the pattern carve tool, matching the fine/V/U gouge behavior.
- **Live swatch preview**: Pattern swatches in Carving Workbench reflect current density and rotation settings in real-time. ViewBox-based scale matching (SWATCH_VB=35 in SWATCH_CSS=52) so swatch preview matches actual carved appearance.
- **Wood-tone swatch backgrounds**: Pattern swatches use wood tones instead of black for authentic preview.

Remaining 11A items (deferred):
- Per-zone patterns (Inking Workbench zone editor)
- Expanded pattern library (parallel lines, arcs, cloud swirls, rain dots)

### Phase 12-P0: PWA Reliability Foundations ✅

- **Service worker** (`sw.js`): Cache-first with background update. Caches full app shell. Version-stamped cache name (`mokuri-v24`).
- **Global error handler**: `window.onerror` + `window.onunhandledrejection` → status bar message.
- **Storage quota UI**: Warning when localStorage is full.
- **Print pipeline protection**: try/catch around `pullPrint()` with clean animation dismissal on failure.
- **Canvas context guard**: Null-check on `getContext('2d')` in print engine.

### Mobile & Small-Screen Improvements ✅

Full compose→carve→ink→print workflow now usable on phone (landscape) and tablets.

- **Zoom-compensated handles**: Handle sizes multiply by viewBox-to-viewport ratio (`svgPerPx`), maintaining constant screen size at any zoom. Touch devices (pointer: coarse) get 2× base size. `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` on selection UI.
- **Elements panel toggle**: 🏞️ Compose button toggles Elements panel open/closed (matching workbench pattern). Auto-closes on narrow screens (<850px) when a workbench opens. CSS width + opacity transition.
- **Pinch-to-zoom**: Two-finger gesture on workspace — zoom centered on pinch midpoint with simultaneous pan. Cancels in-progress carve strokes. Pointer events for cross-device support. Includes pointercancel handling.
- **Mobile print fix**: Deckle edge complex polygon clip (~600 vertices) + multiply composite caused blank canvas on mobile Chromium. Refactored to simple rect clips during rendering with final cosmetic deckle mask via evenodd clip. Also added `willReadFrequently: true` on presentation canvas and try/catch around post-processing.
- **Print preview zoom**: Removed fit-to-workspace clamping in `positionPrintCanvas()`. Canvas tracks paper rect directly, allowing zoom-in for proofing before PNG save.

## Phase 11B — The Wood Block Experience ✅

The workspace now feels like working with a physical block of cherry wood. In compose and carve modes, the surface is a warm wood block with subtle grain texture. In ink mode, it reverts to paper (the "proof pull" preview). The transition is instant.

#### 11B-1: Wood Block Surface ✅
- **Wood surface color** (`WOOD_SURFACE`): Mid wood tone (`#7a6955`) as base fill for the workspace in compose/carve modes.
- **SVG wood grain pattern**: `<pattern id="wood-grain-surface">` — large tile (120×120), 6 horizontal curves at varying opacity for subtle organic grain.
- **Wood texture filter**: `<filter id="wood-texture">` — elongated feTurbulence (horizontal bias `0.008 0.05`, 3 octaves) for warm brown surface.
- **Surface mode switcher**: `updateWorkspaceSurface()` toggles paper fill/filter/grain between wood and paper based on viewMode.
- **Atmosphere gating**: `renderAtmosphere()` only renders in ink mode — compose/carve show the wood block, not the scene.

#### 11B-2: Carved Recess Treatment ✅
- **Recess tones** (`WOOD_RECESS_TONES`): 5 tones 8–12% lighter than surface — fresh-cut wood appearance in element recesses.
- **Carved detail**: PAPER_COLOR fills for carved areas read naturally as cuts through wood into paper beneath.

#### 11B Cursor & Interaction Fixes ✅
- **Tool cursor scoped to paper**: Carve/erase tool cursors (gouge shapes, eraser) only show when hovering over the paper canvas. Crosshair cursor outside paper. `.over-paper` class toggled in pointermove via SVG coordinate bounds check. Carve ring indicator also hidden off-paper.
- **Pan from outside paper**: Clicking empty space outside the paper in carve/erase mode now starts a pan drag (previously did nothing). Background carving/erasing still works within paper bounds.
- **Print studio cursor cleanup**: `openPrintStudio()` calls `setMode('select')` before switching view mode, clearing carve cursor when entering print.
- **Post-print view restore**: `closePrintStudio()` properly restores wood block view mode when returning from print.
- **Compose button fix**: Compose button now reliably closes Print studio on all screen sizes. Previously gated on `composePanelOpen` state, which was false on narrow screens where the compose panel auto-closes. `closePrintStudio()` accepts `restorePanel=false` to suppress panel restoration when switching directly to compose.

### About Screen Redesign ✅

Landscape two-column layout replacing the vertical scrolling makimono.

- **Vermillion hanko seal**: Single 墨 kanji in `#c23b22` square seal, matching the favicon brand mark. Consistent single-character brand identity across favicon, toolbar, about screen, and splash.
- **Two-column layout**: Left column: seal + MOKURI title + philosophy text. Right column: 2×2 grid of step cards (景 Compose, 彫 Carve, 墨 Ink, 摺 Make Print). No scroll needed on desktop/tablet.
- **Toolbar brand**: Red 墨 kanji + "Mokuri Studio" in toolbar, clickable to open About. On narrow screens collapses to just the red kanji. Replaced gallery About link.
- **Responsive**: Compact two-column at ≤500px height (landscape phone), single column with scroll at ≤700px width (portrait phone), philosophy hidden at ≤400px height (very small landscape).

### Element Library Quality & Expansion ✅

Systematic quality pass across the element library guided by a new Element Design Guide (`ELEMENT-GUIDE.md`), plus two new element categories.

#### Element Design Guide ✅
Established a reusable design spec (`docs/ELEMENT-GUIDE.md`) codifying the Mokuri element aesthetic: block→shape→detail carve level accumulation, fill-only block level, organic hand-drawn geometry, zone-based coloring, and woodblock-appropriate detail density. Used as the reference for all subsequent element work.

#### Element Fixes & Redesigns ✅
- **Lantern fixes**: Kasuga Grand Lantern, Yukimi Lantern, Oribe Lantern — fixed carve level accumulation so block⊂shape⊂detail, split single-blob fills into proper zones.
- **Great Peak fix**: Corrected inconsistent snow cap geometry between levels, carried forward ridge strokes.
- **Flora redesigns**: Cherry Blossom, Pine Bough, Maple Branch redesigned with organic hand-drawn aesthetic following the Element Design Guide — richer detail, proper hatching, form-following texture lines.
- **Wooden Bridge redesign**: Rebuilt as arched soribashi (4→7→11 paths), fill-only block, proper level accumulation. Served as the test case for the Element Design Guide.
- **Mountain element redesign**: All 4 mountains rebuilt with organic Q-curves replacing angular L-line paths. Distant Mountain: undulating ridgeline with asymmetric peaks. Near Mountain: natural ravine shadow zone, rounded tree suggestions. Great Peak (Fuji): iconic volcanic profile with convex slopes, wide summit, and concave crater cup. Rolling Hills: improved tree crowns and grass tufts.
- **Rock, Path & Iris redesign**: Rock Formation, Stone Path, and Iris Cluster redesigned with organic geometry.
- **Hanko rendering**: Font-traced 墨 glyph for Mokuri hanko element, sharper hanko character rendering in prints.
- **Basic forms shape level**: Added shape carve level to all basic form elements (previously had only block and detail).

#### New Landscape & Flora Elements ✅
Rolling Hills, Farmland, Tranquil Pond, Waterfall, Chrysanthemum, Susuki Grass, Bare Winter Branch — organic silhouettes with woodblock-appropriate detail at each carve level.

#### Water Elements ✅
Flowing Stream (replaced Great Wave), Shore Waves, River Rapids, Water Ripples — 4 new water elements for landscape compositions. Q-curves for organic water forms, M-move technique for flow/ripple detail lines. All follow element-guide.md accumulation rule strictly.

#### New Objects ✅
Fishing Boat — hull, cabin, and sail zones with plank detail at level 2.

#### Human Figures Category ✅
New `figures-elements.js` with 8 staffage figures in the ukiyo-e tradition: Traveler, Umbrella Figure, Fisherman, Field Worker, Two Travelers, Seated Figure, Boatman, Woman with Bundle. Small-scale figures designed as compositional accents — simplified forms, expressive silhouettes, 2–3 color zones each.

#### Built Structures ✅
Pagoda, Tea House, Bamboo Fence, Farmhouse added to `scene-elements.js`. Multi-zone architecture with structural detail (roof tiles, lattice screens, bamboo lashing, thatch texture) emerging at higher carve levels. Replaced the non-functional Temple Roof element approach with properly designed structures.

### Print Presentation ✅

Authentic print presentation features wrapping the existing print output — margins, edges, title, and edition numbering matching real woodblock print display conventions.

- **Paper margins**: 4 presets (None, Narrow, Standard, Wide) with asymmetric bottom margin larger than sides and top, matching traditional print mounting. Two-canvas wrapper architecture — existing print canvas composited onto a larger presentation canvas.
- **Organic print edge**: Semi-transparent paper-color overlay at the print boundary, softening the transition between inked area and paper margin. Painted over the composite for authentic edge bleed.
- **Deckle edge**: Subtle irregular paper boundary with torn-edge path and wispy fiber decorations. Configurable on/off.
- **Embossed title (karazuri)**: Title text rendered in paper-base color with canvas shadow API — dark shadow lower-right for depth, light highlight upper-left for raised edge. Pre-flipped for correct reading after the print engine's global mirror. Font scales proportionally to bottom margin height.
- **Edition numbering**: Pencil-style edition text (e.g., "1/25") below the title with matching emboss treatment. Smaller font, right-justified under the print edge.
- **Viewport fitting**: Presentation canvas scales to fit entirely within the workspace regardless of aspect ratio.
- **PNG export**: Save includes full presentation with margins. Filename uses composition name.
- **Margin aspect ratio fix**: Corrected distortion in margin rendering that stretched prints at non-standard aspect ratios.

### Atmosphere Expansion ✅

- **Golden & Pink sky types**: Two new atmosphere options added to the existing 6 sky types, expanding creative range for warm/romantic scene lighting.
- **Atmosphere system redesign** (v0.79–0.80): Renamed golden→warm, pink→sakura, none→Paper. Added Haze background and Stone foreground. smoothHorizon flag for clean gradient edges (interior/still-life contexts). 14 atmosphere presets across Core, Kacho-e, and Moribana packs. Preset chip UI in Inking Workbench with collapsible raw controls. Palette visual grouping by pack. Full design doc: `docs/mokuri_atmosphere_proposal.md`.

### Rendering & Interaction Polish ✅

- **Element viewBox clipping**: Elements now clip to their viewBox bounds in both workspace and print engine, preventing path overflow from bleeding into surrounding composition space.
- **Baren animation scaling**: Baren burnishing animation and pressure pattern scale proportionally with paper size, maintaining authentic feel across all paper presets.
- **Toolbar overflow fix**: Zoom controls hide gracefully before Gallery button clips on narrow screens.
- **Paper dimensions display**: Paper dimensions shown in status bar and on gallery preset cards.

### Composition Guides ✅

Wire-line overlay showing paper boundaries and rule-of-thirds grid. Helps compose intentional scenes and see composition edges even when elements extend beyond the paper.

- **8 guide lines**: 4 border lines at paper edges + 4 rule-of-thirds lines, all extending ~20 SVG units beyond paper corners.
- **Dual-stroke halo**: White inner line with dark outer halo — visible against wood tones, paper, dark and bright atmospheres.
- **Non-scaling strokes**: Consistent line weight at any zoom level. `pointer-events: none` for zero interaction interference.
- **Toggle**: `G` key or toolbar button (⊞). Persisted in localStorage. Off by default.

### Layer Management ✅

Improved z-order control for complex compositions with many overlapping elements.

- **Bring to Front / Send to Back**: `Shift+]` and `Shift+[` keyboard shortcuts jump selected element(s) to the top or bottom of the stack. Long-press (400ms) on ▲/▼ toolbar buttons for touch.
- **Tap-through selection**: Clicking an already-selected element cycles selection to the element below it in the stack. Full-stack cycling — continues through all overlapping elements and wraps around. Uses rotation-aware bounding box hit testing (`elementsAtPoint()`).
- **Tab cycling**: `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycles through overlapping elements at the selected element's center point.

---

### Kacho-e Style Pack (花鳥画) ✅

First expansion pack — birds and flowers in the intimate kacho-e tradition.

- **9 elements** in `assets/kacho-elements.js`: Heron Standing, Bush Warbler, Swallow in Flight, Kingfisher, Egret, Peony, Lotus, Morning Glory, Wisteria. Close-up nature subjects with 3-level carve accumulation and rich zone coloring.
- **2 palettes**: Haru 春 (spring pastels), Natsu 夏 (deep summer tones).
- **Pack manifest** (`assets/kacho-pack.js`): 2 journeys (Your First Kacho-e, Seasonal Pairing), 10 creative prompts across scene/constraint/transformation/emotion types.
- **Pack registry integration**: Elements tagged `pack: 'kacho-e'`, palettes merged into PALETTES at startup.

### Moribana Style Pack (盛花) ✅

Ikebana-inspired still-life — vessels, refined florals, and structural branches for arrangement compositions.

- **11 elements** in `assets/moribana-elements.js`:
  - **4 vessels**: Suiban (shallow basin), Tsubo (ceramic vase), Hanaire (bamboo vase), Chawan (tea bowl)
  - **4 flowers**: Kiku (chrysanthemum), Tsubaki (camellia), Ran (orchid spray), Suisen (narcissus)
  - **3 branches/accents**: Ume Branch (angular plum with blossoms), Matsu Branch (pine with needle clusters), Kenzan (pin frog holder)
- **3 palettes** inspired by Japanese ceramic glazes: Seiji 青磁 (celadon cool), Shino 志野 (autumn warm), Raku 楽 (dramatic black/vermillion).
- **Pack manifest** (`assets/moribana-pack.js`): 2 journeys (Your First Arrangement, Seasonal Harmony), 10 creative prompts. Affinity-based companion discovery replaces hand-curated companion list.
- **Design document**: `docs/moribana_style_pack.md` — element specs, scale relationships, atmosphere pairings, companion strategy.

### Active Style Model ✅

Transforms style packs from content filters into distinct creative contexts that shape the entire studio environment. See `docs/plan.md` for full design.

- **Element tag system**: 17-tag vocabulary (`landscape`, `flora`, `fauna`, `water`, `structural`, `atmospheric`, `vessel`, `minimal`, `organic`, `geometric`, `figure`, `intimate`, `seasonal-spring/autumn/winter`, `decorative`, `signing`) applied to all 112 elements. Tags describe what the element *is* and what creative contexts it suits.
- **Pack affinity**: Each pack declares `affinity: [...]` — tags it's drawn to. `getAffinityElements(packId, allElements)` computes `{ featured, rest }` by tag overlap (2+ threshold). Elements with more matching tags rank higher. Scales automatically as elements are added.
- **Single active style**: `STATE.activeStyle` (string) replaces old `STATE.activePacks` (Set). One pack sets the creative context at a time. Core Mokuri (landscape/nature) is a first-class style, not "everything."
- **Style selector**: Chips at top of Elements panel. Status bar badge shows current style.
- **Two-tier element picker**: Featured section (pack's own elements + affinity-matched core elements) sorted by category size. "All Elements ▶" collapsible accordion below — nothing hidden, just prioritized.
- **Palette & prompt filtering**: Inking Workbench shows active style palettes + core. Workshop prompts from active style + core only.
- **Smart defaults**: Switching styles auto-selects pack's first palette. Non-destructive — elements already placed stay.
- **Atmosphere rename**: `sky` → `background`, `ground` → `foreground` throughout STATE, UI, save/load, gallery presets, audio engine. Save/load migration reads both old and new keys.

### Phone Layouts & Status Bar ✅

Full phone support for portrait and landscape orientations.

- **Portrait toolbar** (≤500px width): 3-row layout — brand left-justified with "墨 Mokuri" text, mode buttons with labels (Compose/Carve/Ink/Print), edit tools centered below. Spacer capped at 16px between brand and modes.
- **Landscape toolbar** (≤920px, ≤500px height): 2-row layout — brand left, mode+nav centered via flex spacers, edit tools below.
- **Brand tap detection fix**: Switched from `pointerup` (unreliable on touch — `pointerleave` fires on slight finger movement) to `click` event for About screen. Long-press (1500ms) retained for dev-styles toggle with `_brandLongPressed` flag to prevent double-fire.
- **Status bar phone fixes**: Portrait — single-line with `flex-wrap: nowrap`, hint truncation via `text-overflow: ellipsis`, zoom % and view controls hidden. Landscape — zoom/grid controls visible, spacer div for right-justification.
- **Style pack indicator removed** from status bar (redundant with Elements panel indicator).

### Audio Background Muting ✅

`AudioContext.suspend()` on `document.visibilitychange` hidden, `resume()` on visible. Stops all audio instantly when switching apps on phone/tablet. Replaces the previous resume-only handler.

### FRE Hardening ✅

Reliability improvements to the guided first-run experience:

- **Fresh canvas on Begin Creating**: `freStartJourney` accepts `opts.freshCanvas` — auto-saves current work, creates new composition, loads journey preset. "Begin Creating" passes `{ freshCanvas: true }`, journey chaining ("Try next") continues on the current canvas.
- **Print preview cleanup**: `resetToCompose()` called before journey transitions to close print preview.
- **Cancellation safety**: `switchToComposition()` and `newComposition()` both cancel any active FRE journey.
- **Async flow**: `freStartJourney` is fully async — callers `await` it so autoSave/setActiveCompositionId chain completes before UI updates.

### User Feedback Collection — Phase A ✅

Google Form–based feedback with automatic app context pre-fill. Form guide: `docs/mokuri_feedback_form_guide.md`.

- **Google Form**: 9-question form (sentiment, category, details, where, device, screenshot, follow-up, email, app context). Structured responses in Google Sheets.
- **`buildFeedbackUrl()`**: Constructs pre-filled URL with compact context string — version, layout class (phone-portrait/landscape, tablet, desktop), viewport dimensions, session count, element count, active style, current phase. Entry ID: `entry.1359547312`.
- **Makimono/About link**: `💬 Share Feedback` below "Begin Creating" button — always findable.
- **FRE celebration link**: `How was this experience? 💬` on final journey (evening-scene) celebration toast.
- **Post-print nudge**: Centered FRE-style toast after pulling a print (session 2+, not during FRE). "Share Feedback" and "Not Now" buttons. One-time only (`mokuri-feedback-nudge` localStorage flag). Auto-dismisses after 20 seconds.
- **`testFeedbackNudge()`**: Console helper for previewing the nudge without persisting the shown flag.

### Touch Handle Hit Areas ✅

Invisible 36×36px transparent hit rects behind all resize/rotate handles on `pointer: coarse` devices. Visible handles unchanged — pointer events pass through to the larger invisible targets. Covers single-element corner handles, edge midpoint handles, rotation handle, and group selection corner handles. Mouse behavior unaffected.

### Workshop Inspiration Box (Hidden)

Inspiration prompt section in Workshop panel hidden pending feature redesign. `refreshWorkshopPrompt()` short-circuits to `display:none`. HTML, CSS, and remaining JS preserved for future use.

### Style Pack Design Documents ✅

- **Kacho-e** (`docs/kachoe_style_pack.md`): Comprehensive design doc — 11 element specs, seasonal pairing guide, palette analysis, gallery preset proposals, quality gap assessment.
- **Machi** (`docs/machi_style_pack.md`): Architecture pack design doc — 12 elements, 2 palettes, 4 gallery presets, 2 journeys, 10 prompts. Meisho-e tradition.

### Hanko Rendering Fix ✅

Fixed hanko elements rendering in vermillion color during Compose and Carve modes. All elements now correctly use wood recess tones in non-ink modes; hanko vermillion only applies in Ink mode.

---

## Future Work

### Active Style — Remaining Phases

- **Atmosphere presets** ✅: 14 named presets across Core (6), Kacho-e (4), and Moribana (4). Preset chip row in Inking Workbench above collapsible raw controls. Pack presets shown first with separator. Includes smoothHorizon support for interior contexts, option renames (golden→warm, pink→sakura), new Haze background and Stone foreground. Palette visual grouping (pack palettes above divider).
- **Journey activation**: First-switch journey prompt when user activates a style for the first time.
- **Pack gallery presets**: Curated starting compositions per pack.
- **Affinity tuning**: Refine tag weights through real use. Consider weighted affinities.
- **Element category ordering**: Element categories in the picker currently sort by group size + alphabetical tiebreak, which feels random and unintuitive. Each style pack should define an intentional category display order (e.g., landscape → flora → fauna → figures → objects → hanko for core Mokuri) rather than relying on computed sort.

### Style Packs (Expansion Content)
Active Style model and two packs shipped. Next candidates:
- **Tsukiyo (月夜)** — Moonlit Night pack. Night-specific elements (lanterns, fireflies, owl, fox, ancient tree, moon reflection, stars), 3 nocturnal palettes, atmospheric compositions. Full design doc: `docs/tsukiyo_style_pack.md`. Also includes 4 perspective landscape elements added to Core.
- **Machi (街)** — Town & Architecture pack. Meisho-e tradition — townscapes, built structures, architectural mood pieces. Potential elements: castle keep, machiya (townhouse), shrine gate variants, harbor/wharf, merchant stall, stone wall, tile rooftops. Design challenges: consistent perspective convention (oblique/flat view matching existing buildings), right detail level for carve levels, scale relationships between large structures (castle) and small ones (stall). High creative reward — genuinely new compositional vocabulary for Mokuri. Design doc TBD.
- **Gendai (現代)** — Modern Mokuhanga pack. Contemporary subjects rendered with the same care and technique as traditional ones — a pigeon where you'd expect a crane, utility poles where you'd expect pines, urban stairwells and apartment grids. Honors the global contemporary mokuhanga movement: strong graphic silhouettes, radically reduced palettes (2–3 colors), deliberate wood grain visibility, large flat color areas. Elements: telephone/utility pole, apartment window grid, bicycle, fire escape, city birds (pigeon, crow), contemporary figures (coat, umbrella, figure from behind), close-cropped botanical studies (moss, single leaf, lichen), geometric architectural forms. Design premise: find the traditional aesthetic in contemporary subjects.
- Additional contrasting packs to validate the Active Style model with non-landscape creative contexts.

### First-Run Experience ✅ (Core Complete + Hardened)
Two-journey guided onboarding built on the pack journey system:
- **Journey engine**: start, advance, resume, complete, skip with IndexedDB persistence. Hint-per-step state machine with `freAdvance(triggerId)` calls at 11+ action points throughout the app.
- **Hint overlay system**: Pale blue italic bubbles with directional arrows, pulse glow on targets, auto-positioning with viewport clamping and overflow fallback. Z-index layered above all panels including gallery modal.
- **First-print journey** (7 steps): move → resize → carve → carve-level → palette → open print studio → pull print. Loads curated preset, selects last element (top layer), auto-names composition "My First Mokuri Print", deselects before palette step.
- **Evening-scene journey** (7 steps): open ink → change background atmosphere → open print studio → edit title → pull print → open gallery → exit gallery. Celebration toast with ensō (◯) mark and Workshop guidance.
- **Audio cues**: Pentatonic chimes from the ambient D-minor scale (D4+A4 fifth for hints, D4→G4→A4→D5 ascending motif with bell shimmer for celebration).
- **Celebration toast**: Ensō circle with journey titleJa, completion message, persistent until dismissed. Optional "Try next" button chains to suggested journey. Feedback link on final journey completion.
- **"Begin Creating" always starts FRE** from the Makimono/About screen — fresh canvas regardless of existing work. Journey chaining continues on current canvas.
- **iPad tap-to-place**: iOS touch and pen use tap-to-arm then tap-workspace due to confirmed WebKit compositor limitation (pointercancel on all non-mouse drag in scrollable containers).

Remaining FRE work:
- Phase 5: Workshop journey cards section — visual journey browser in Workshop panel.
- Phase 6: Polish — panel conflict handling, touch target sizing, edge cases, third journey (weather-study).

### Element Fidelity
- **Continued SVG refinement** — Mountain and water elements now follow the Element Design Guide. Remaining older elements (particularly some flora and objects predating the guide) could benefit from the same organic Q-curve treatment. Hatching density, form-following texture lines, and zone boundary refinement are ongoing opportunities.

### Composition & Creativity

- **Element auto-scale on placement** — Elements currently place at `scale: 1` using raw viewBox dimensions, causing large variability in visual size across elements. Normalize initial scale relative to paper size (e.g., target ~15-20% of paper width) so a mountain and a moon land at comparable visual sizes. Per-element `suggestedScale` override for intentional size differences.
- **More scene presets** — Seasonal themes, time-of-day variations, genre-specific starters (seascape, garden, urban, spiritual).
- **Border & corner elements** — Corner ornaments, edge repeaters as a new element category with edge-snapping behavior.
- **Frame presets** — Pre-composed corner+edge combinations for one-click decorative borders.
- **Composition guide extensions** — Golden ratio overlay, horizon-line guide synced with atmosphere slider, diagonal composition lines.

### Platform & Polish
- **Portrait mode support** ✅ — Full portrait layout for iPad mini/Air/13". Element panel becomes 2-row horizontal shelf (CSS Grid for Safari compatibility). Workbench panels become compact bottom sheets: Print (3-col), Carve (2-col), Ink (3-col with always-expanded palette grid). Two-row toolbar with labeled phase buttons, brand left-aligned, Gallery/Workshop separated from workflow phases. Status bar overflow protection. ViewBox guard for orientation transitions. FRE works in portrait without modification.
- **Phone support** ✅ — Portrait (≤500px) and landscape (≤920×500) toolbar layouts, status bar single-line with truncation, audio background muting, 36px invisible touch hit areas on handles.
- **Responsive layout** — Further phone refinements possible: bottom sheet panels, modal panels for workbench flyouts on very small screens.
- **Keyboard shortcuts expansion** — More shortcuts for power users.

### User Feedback Collection
Phased approach — start simple, layer on richer options as distribution expands.

**Phase A: Google Form link ✅**
- Google Form with 9 questions (sentiment, category, details, where, device, screenshot, follow-up, email, app context). Responses in Google Sheets.
- `buildFeedbackUrl()` pre-fills app context (version, layout, viewport, session count, elements, style, phase) via `entry.1359547312`.
- 💬 link on Makimono/About screen, FRE celebration toast, and one-time post-print nudge.
- Form guide: `docs/mokuri_feedback_form_guide.md`.

**Phase B: In-app feedback modal (post-Capacitor)**
- Build a lightweight modal inside Mokuri: emoji rating (😐🙂😊), category chips (Bug / Idea / Question), free-text textarea.
- Submit via Formspree.io or Formsubmit.co — single `fetch()` POST, no backend needed. Free tier (~50 submissions/month).
- Queue submissions if offline; send when connectivity returns.
- Accessible from About screen and optionally from a subtle status bar icon.

**Phase C: App Store review prompts (Capacitor native builds only)**
- Use `@capacitor/app-review` to prompt for ratings at natural moments (after pulling a print, after saving a composition).
- Apple and Google handle review collection and display. Requires Phase 13 (Capacitor) to be complete.

### Print Engine
- **Advanced bokashi** — Multi-directional gradients, radial fades, more nuanced ink distribution.
- **Registration marks** — Visual guides showing block alignment for multi-color printing authenticity.
- **Seal placement** — Hanko seal stamp positioning on the presentation margin (deferred from Print Presentation).

## Phase 12 — PWA Quality & Reliability (Planned)

Architecture assessment identified gaps in offline support, error handling, and data safety. P0 complete; P1–P3 planned.

### 12-P0: Reliability Foundations ✅

See completed section above.

### 12-P1: Export/Import Compositions ✅

Single `.mokuri` JSON file format for both individual and bulk export/import.

- **File format**: `{ mokuri: 1, compositions: [...] }` — name, data, timestamps. Same format for single and bulk. IDs and thumbnails regenerated on import.
- **Export single**: Per-card ↓ download button in gallery. Downloads `{name}.mokuri`.
- **Export all**: "Export All" button in gallery toolbar. Downloads `mokuri-backup-{date}.mokuri`.
- **Import**: "Import" button in gallery toolbar. File picker (`.mokuri`/`.json`). Compositions added with fresh IDs and thumbnails. No gallery size limit enforcement on import. Validation checks mokuri:1 marker and element data.

### 12-P1: Marquee Selection & Group Resize ✅

- **Marquee selection**: Ctrl/Cmd+drag (mouse/pen) or long-press+drag (touch/pen) draws selection rectangle. Elements selected by center point. Additive with Ctrl/Cmd, replaces on touch.
- **Long-press feedback**: Animated progress ring (24 SVG units, 300ms, white) confirms activation on touch/pen.
- **Adaptive selection colors**: White boxes/rect in compose/carve modes (high contrast on wood tones), accent brown in ink mode.
- **Group resize**: Proportional corner-handle resize for multi-selected elements. Group AABB from rotated corners, locked elements excluded, undo/redo supported.

**Deferred (future consideration):**
- Group rotation (rotate all selected around group center)
- Batch ink settings for elements sharing the same definition or color zones

### 12-P1.5: IndexedDB Storage Migration ✅

Migrated all composition and print storage from localStorage to IndexedDB, removing the ~5MB browser cap and enabling the Print Gallery feature.

- **MokuriDB abstraction layer**: IIFE with lazy-open pattern. Three object stores: `compositions` (keyPath: id, index: updatedAt), `prints` (autoIncrement, indexes: createdAt, compositionId), `meta` (keyPath: key).
- **Async gallery API**: All ~15 call sites converted to async (autoSave, autoLoad, switchToComposition, deleteComposition, renameComposition, buildWorkshopUI, import/export, etc.).
- **One-time migration**: Reads existing localStorage `mokuri-gallery`, writes to IDB, verifies round-trip, then removes localStorage keys. Invisible to user.
- **localStorage fallback**: `_useLocalStorage` flag for private browsing or broken IDB state.
- **Storage cap removed**: No more MAX_GALLERY_SIZE limit. IndexedDB provides hundreds of MB.
- **Print storage**: `savePrint`, `getAllPrints`, `getPrint`, `deletePrint`, `updatePrint`, `getPrintCount` methods. Canvas-to-Blob helper, 300px thumbnail generator.
- **User progress helpers**: `getUserStage`, `setUserStage`, `getSessionCount`, `incrementSessionCount`, `getJourneyProgress`, `updateJourneyProgress`, `getPromptHistory`, `addPromptToHistory` — foundation for FRE and pack system.

### Print Gallery (画 Gallery) ✅

Auto-saved print collection with unified viewer, sharing, and favorites.

- **Auto-save on pull**: Every `pullPrint()` saves a full-resolution PNG blob + 300px thumbnail to IndexedDB. Lifetime print counter in meta store.
- **Unified viewer**: Full-screen dark brown backdrop. Most recent print shown immediately on open — zero extra clicks. Thumbnail strip at bottom for navigation. Arrow keys, ‹/› buttons, and swipe gestures for navigation.
- **Top bar**: Title, print counter, artist name input, All/★ Favorites filter tabs, action buttons (☆ Keep, ↗ Share, ↓ Save, ✕ Delete), close button.
- **Favorites**: Toggle via ☆ Keep button. Filter tab shows only favorites. Persisted in IndexedDB.
- **Sharing**: ↗ Share sub-menu with two options:
  - **Mounted PNG**: Canvas-rendered mat with noise texture, drop shadow, title/edition/artist text, "Mokuri Studio" mark.
  - **HTML Viewer**: Self-contained HTML file with base64-embedded print, dark display, responsive layout, metadata.
- **Delete behavior**: Advances to next print (or previous if at end) instead of returning to empty grid.
- **Swipe navigation**: Pointer event-based swipe on viewer area for touch/pen/mouse. Vertical-dominant gestures ignored. 50px threshold. Procedural swipe sound (filtered noise whoosh).
- **Audio cues**: `playSave` (ascending chime), `playFavorite` (two-note sparkle), `playSwipe` (bandpass noise whoosh).
- **Custom confirmation**: `mokConfirm()` — Promise-based styled dialog replacing browser `confirm()`. Backdrop dismiss, reusable.
- **Responsive**: Thumbnails scale by breakpoint (60px mobile, 80px default, 96px ≥900px). Short-window adjustments. Action button labels hidden on mobile (icon-only).
- **Hotkey**: J key toggles gallery. Escape closes.

### Workshop Rename (作 Workshop) ✅

Renamed the old "Gallery" (composition launcher) to **Workshop** to resolve naming collision with the new Print Gallery.

- ~130 references renamed across CSS classes, HTML IDs, JS functions, variables, and user-visible text.
- Kanji icon: **作** (saku, create/make). Section headings: "Create a new composition" / "Return to recent work".
- **Inspiration prompts**: Random creative prompt displayed below presets with 🎲 refresh button. Click prompt to start new composition. Prompts sourced from pack registry.

### Pack Infrastructure ✅

Foundation for style packs and first-run experience — data models and registry without any gating or FRE behavior.

- **Pack registry** (`assets/pack-registry.js`): `MOKURI_PACKS` array with `registerPack()`, `getPackById()`, `getAllPacks()`, `getPackForElement()`, `getPackPrompts()`, `getPackJourneys()` helpers.
- **Core pack manifest**: 90 element IDs, 10 palette IDs, 3 creative journeys (first-print, evening-scene, weather-study), 14 prompts across 4 types (scene, emotion, constraint, transformation).
- **Element tagging**: `pack: 'core'` added to all 90 element definitions across 7 files, all 10 PALETTES entries, and all 9 gallery presets.
- **Pack manifest format**: Supports elements, palettes, presets, journeys (with progressive disclosure hints and suggested next), and standalone prompts — designed to support both style packs and FRE without retrofit.
- **Element picker awareness**: Sub-groups elements by pack within categories when multiple packs contribute (no-op with only core, ready for expansion).
- **User progress model**: Session count, user stage, journey progress, prompt history — all persisted in IndexedDB meta store.

### Mobile & Interaction Fixes ✅

- **Two-row toolbar** (portrait phone ≤600px): Row 1: brand + phase buttons + Workshop. Row 2: edit tools centered. Touch targets bumped to 36px. No impact on landscape or larger screens.
- **Multi-selection flip fix**: Flip now mirrors element positions around the group centroid, making the operation visually meaningful even for symmetric shapes (basic forms). Single-element flip unchanged.

### iPad & Touch UX Polish ✅

- **Toolbar icon rendering fix**: Unicode characters (⬆⬇↩↪) rendered as Apple emoji on iOS, looking out of place with Mokuri's muted aesthetic. Fixed with `font-variant-emoji: text` and symbol font stack on `.tool-btn`. Replaced ⬆⬇ with ▲▼ for layer ordering.
- **Touch-friendly status bar**: `@media (pointer: coarse)` scales status bar from 24px→36px height, buttons from 20px→32px, larger volume slider. Touch targets properly sized for finger input on tablets.
- **PWA audio on iOS**: Standalone PWA mode has stricter audio gesture policies than Safari. Added `touchstart` and `pointerdown` to audio gesture listeners alongside `click`/`keydown`. Added `visibilitychange` handler to resume suspended AudioContext after app backgrounding.
- **Element tap-to-place**: WebKit compositor fires `pointercancel` for both pen and finger drags inside scrollable panels — no JS workaround exists. Implemented tap-to-place for all input types on iOS as a reliable alternative to drag-and-drop.
- **Windows drag ghost fix**: `setPointerCapture` inside scrollable containers with `touch-action: pan-y` caused browser compositor conflict, breaking mouse/touch ghost feedback. Removed capture, added `@media (pointer: fine)` override for `touch-action: none` on element thumbs.

### Orihon Gallery View (Future Enhancement)

An accordion-style print viewer inspired by the traditional Japanese *orihon* (折本) format — the folded book used for sutra scrolls and woodblock picture books. Rather than a grid or flat slideshow, prints would unfold horizontally panel by panel with a physical fold animation, creating a ceremonial, contemplative browsing experience distinct from anything in conventional creative apps.

**Concept:**
- Enhancement to the existing Print Gallery, not a replacement — accessible via a toggle or view mode switch
- Center panel is the current print; adjacent panels partially visible at the fold edges
- Paging unfolds the next print from the right edge (or folds the previous back from the left), simulating the orihon opening gesture
- A soft paper-rustle/unfold sound from the audio engine accompanies each turn
- Ambient soundscape continues underneath

**Implementation tradeoffs to consider:**
- A true multi-panel simultaneous accordion (all panels physically connected, folding together) is complex geometry — getting the physics feel right requires careful easing and iteration
- A simplified version — centered panel with fold-out entrance animation, neighbors at reduced scale/depth — delivers ~80% of the beauty at much lower complexity
- Print PNGs are large; lazy-load adjacent panels only (current ±1) to avoid memory pressure on iPad
- The "settle" physics (slight overshoot, dampen to rest) is the difference between beautiful and janky — worth a dedicated tuning pass

**Why it fits Mokuri:**
The existing gallery is functional but utilitarian — a grid of thumbnails. The orihon format would make browsing prints feel like leafing through a folio, matching the meditative register of the rest of the tool. Combined with the ambient soundscape it could be a genuinely distinctive experience.

### Print Gallery Slide Animation ✅

Contemplative slide transitions when browsing prints — arrows, thumbnails, and swipe gestures all animate with a physical, print-handling feel.

- **Three-phase animation**: Slide out (400ms ease-out with scale-down to 0.97) → brief pause (75ms breath) → slide in (350ms with gentle overshoot settle). Separate CSS classes for out/in with distinct easing curves.
- **Swipe tracking**: Finger/pen drag tracks position with proportional scale-down and opacity fade. Threshold-based commit or snap-back with overshoot bounce.
- **Tunable constants**: `_GSLIDE_OUT`, `_GSLIDE_PAUSE`, `_GSLIDE_IN` at top of function for easy timing adjustments.

## Audio Engine — Improvements & Gaps

### Atmosphere Coverage Gaps (Bug Fixes)

The audio engine's `setAmbienceForAtmosphere(sky, ground)` was written before several atmosphere types were added. The following types fall through to a generic default and should have tailored responses. Requires SW cache version bump alongside the change.

**Sky gaps** (fall through to mid-register default):
- `warm` — treat like dawn/dusk: warm register, moderate pace, low wind
- `sakura` — higher register, sparser spacing, softer wind; delicate spring character
- `haze` — similar to overcast but more sparse and muted; even quieter wind

**Ground gaps** (only `snow` and `water` are explicitly handled):
- `shallows` — should activate water drops like `water`; slightly lighter wind
- `moss` / `grass` — subtle wind increase, slight organic dampness character; no water drops
- `sand` — dry, high-frequency wind filter; no water; minimal
- `stone` — similar to sand; cold, still, minimal
- `earth` — slight warm wind; dry; no water

All are low-complexity switch-case additions. Test on dev branch before merging — verify each atmosphere combination sounds intentional, not jarring.

---

### Composition-Aware Audio (Future Enhancement)

Currently the soundscape responds only to atmosphere (sky/ground) settings — not to the content of the composition itself. Lightweight improvements that wouldn't add meaningful complexity:

**Fauna/flora layer:**
- Scan placed elements for category tags at composition load and on element add/remove
- If `fauna` elements present: occasional soft bird chirp or insect sound (procedural, pentatonic-aligned) layered over the ambient chimes
- If `flora` heavy (e.g. bamboo, sakura, maple): shift chime character slightly — shorter decay, denser spacing, more wind

**Implementation notes:**
- Read `STATE.elements` categories at ambient start and on element placement/deletion
- No need for real-time continuous scanning — recompute on composition change events
- Keep sounds subtle: they should feel discovered, not announced
- Bird chirps: short FM synthesis burst (sine carrier, sine modulator, fast envelope); 2-3 pitches from the current scale pool
- Insect texture: very short noise burst through a high bandpass (4–8kHz), extremely low volume

**Why keep it limited:**
The soundscape's strength is that it's ambient — felt, not heard. Adding too many reactive layers risks making it feel like a video game rather than a meditative environment. The fauna/flora addition is the one tier that feels thematically grounded without crossing that line.

---

#### Memory Bounds
Carve stroke arrays are unbounded. Heavy sessions could grow to MB, bloating undo snapshots and localStorage.

- **Cap background carve strokes**: Warn user when approaching limit (e.g., 500 strokes). Oldest strokes merged or flattened.
- **Cap per-element strokes**: Similar limit with visual feedback.
- **Undo snapshot size awareness**: Track approximate undo stack memory; shed oldest entries if exceeding threshold.

#### Event Listener Hygiene
`setupInteraction()` registers listeners but never removes them. Modal/panel rebuilds may accumulate handlers.

- **Audit listener registration**: Ensure `setupInteraction()` is called exactly once.
- **Named handler references**: Store handler references for cleanup if needed.
- **Panel rebuild guards**: Ensure `buildCarveStudioUI()` etc. don't accumulate click handlers.

### 12-P2: Accessibility & Performance

#### Basic Accessibility
Zero ARIA attributes, no focus management, no `:focus-visible` styles. Icon buttons unlabeled.

- **ARIA labels**: Add `aria-label` to all icon buttons, `role` to interactive divs.
- **Focus management**: Tab order through toolbar → panels → workspace. `:focus-visible` styles.
- **Live regions**: Status bar as `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements.

#### Targeted SVG Updates
`rerenderAll()` rebuilds the entire SVG tree on every change. Expensive for large compositions.

- **Dirty-element tracking**: Only re-render changed elements instead of full clear+rebuild.
- **Attribute-only updates**: For color/opacity changes, update attributes in place rather than recreating DOM nodes.

#### Print Engine Threading
All print work runs on main thread, blocking UI during the 500–2000ms render.

- **OffscreenCanvas + Worker**: Move post-processing (color muting, ink absorption, baren, wood grain, noise) to a Web Worker. SVG rasterization stays on main thread (requires DOM).

### 12-P3: Build & Optimization

#### Code Optimization
410KB total unminified JavaScript+HTML served directly. No code splitting.

- **Minification**: HTML/CSS/JS minification for production deploy (GitHub Actions workflow).
- **Lazy-load print engine**: Only load print-engine.js when user enters Print phase.

## Phase 13 — Native App Distribution via Capacitor (Planned)

Wrap Mokuri in Capacitor to publish on iOS App Store and Google Play while keeping the existing PWA and GitHub Pages deployment intact. Mokuri's zero-dependency, offline-first, pure browser architecture (SVG + Canvas + Web Audio) makes it an ideal Capacitor candidate — no native plugins required for core functionality.

### Why Capacitor

- **~95% code reuse** — Mokuri runs as-is inside a native WebView. No framework migration, no rewrite.
- **Eliminates PWA friction on iOS** — no "Add to Home Screen" dance, no Safari storage eviction, full-screen without address bar.
- **App Store presence** — discoverability, credibility, potential monetization path.
- **Additive** — PWA continues to work. Capacitor is an additional distribution channel, not a replacement.

### Prerequisites

Complete before starting Capacitor work:
- **IndexedDB migration (12-P1.5)** — eliminates localStorage 5MB ceiling. IndexedDB works reliably in Capacitor WebViews.
- **npm init** — Capacitor requires a `package.json`. Mokuri currently has none. This is a lightweight addition (no build step needed).

### Development Environment

All day-to-day development stays on Windows. Mac access is only needed for iOS signing setup.

- **Android**: Android Studio runs natively on Windows. Full local build/test/deploy cycle.
- **iOS**: Two options for building without owning a Mac:
  1. **GitHub Actions CI** (recommended) — `macos-latest` runner builds the `.ipa` on push. All development on Windows, CI produces signed artifacts. Free tier includes Mac runner minutes.
  2. **Cloud Mac rental** (one-time) — MacStadium, MacinCloud, or XcodeClub for initial provisioning profile and certificate setup (~1 hour). After that, CI handles ongoing builds.
- **macOS VM on Windows** — technically possible but violates Apple's EULA on non-Apple hardware. Not recommended.

### Implementation Steps

#### 13-1: Project Initialization
- `npm init` to create `package.json` (no dependencies beyond Capacitor)
- Install Capacitor: `@capacitor/core`, `@capacitor/cli`
- `npx cap init` — configure app name ("Mokuri"), app ID (`art.mokuri.app`), web directory (`.`)
- Add `capacitor.config.ts` with WebView preferences (no bounce, status bar style, background color)
- `.gitignore` additions: `node_modules/`, `android/`, `ios/` (native projects are generated, not committed)

#### 13-2: Android Build
- `npm install @capacitor/android && npx cap add android`
- `npx cap copy android && npx cap open android`
- Configure in Android Studio: app icon (existing `icon-512.png`), splash screen, permissions (none needed — Mokuri is offline-only)
- Test on emulator and physical device
- Build signed APK/AAB for Google Play

#### 13-3: iOS Build via CI
- `npm install @capacitor/ios && npx cap add ios`
- **One-time Mac setup** (cloud Mac rental, ~1 hour):
  - Apple Developer account ($99/year)
  - Create App ID, provisioning profile, distribution certificate
  - Export signing credentials for CI use
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ios-build.yml`):
  - Trigger: push to `main` or manual dispatch
  - Runner: `macos-latest`
  - Steps: checkout → npm install → `npx cap copy ios` → `xcodebuild archive` → export `.ipa`
  - Signing via GitHub Secrets (certificate + provisioning profile)
  - Artifact: signed `.ipa` uploaded to workflow artifacts or App Store Connect

#### 13-4: Service Worker Considerations
- Capacitor apps have their own offline model (assets bundled in the native shell)
- **Option A**: Disable service worker registration in Capacitor builds (detect via `window.Capacitor`)
- **Option B**: Keep SW active for caching — harmless but redundant
- Decision: likely Option A for cleaner behavior

#### 13-5: Platform-Specific Enhancements (Optional)
Native features that could enhance Mokuri if desired (none required for launch):
- **Haptic feedback** — subtle vibration on carve strokes (`@capacitor/haptics`)
- **Share sheet** — native share for exported PNGs (`@capacitor/share`)
- **File system** — save/load `.mokuri` files to device storage (`@capacitor/filesystem`)
- **Splash screen** — branded launch screen (`@capacitor/splash-screen`)

#### 13-6: App Store Submission
- **Google Play**: Straightforward — upload AAB, fill metadata, screenshots, submit for review
- **App Store**: Apple scrutinizes "web wrapper" apps, but Mokuri's rich Canvas/SVG interaction, procedural audio, and creative tooling should pass review comfortably (not a thin website wrapper)
- App Store metadata: description, screenshots (phone + tablet), privacy policy (no data collection — easy), age rating

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Apple rejects as "web wrapper" | Mokuri has rich interaction (carving, Canvas rendering, Web Audio) — not a thin wrapper. Add haptic feedback plugin to strengthen native feel if needed. |
| WebView performance for print engine | Canvas rendering is well-optimized in modern WebViews. Test on lower-end devices. OffscreenCanvas Worker (12-P2) would help if needed. |
| iOS signing complexity | One-time setup via cloud Mac. CI handles ongoing builds automatically. |
| Keeping three targets in sync (PWA + Android + iOS) | Single codebase. `npx cap copy` syncs web assets to native projects. CI automates builds. |

### Cost

- **Apple Developer Program**: $99/year
- **Google Play Developer**: $25 one-time
- **Cloud Mac rental**: ~$1–5 for initial 1-hour setup session
- **Ongoing**: $0 (GitHub Actions free tier, development on Windows)
