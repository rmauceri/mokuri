# Mokuri — Roadmap

## Completed: Quality & Creativity Improvements (Phases 1–5)

### Phase 1 — Background & Atmosphere ✅
Added sky (6 types: dawn, day, dusk, night, overcast), ground (6 types: earth, grass, snow, sand, water), horizon slider (20–85%), and 0–3 mist bands. Organic wobble edges, not hard lines. Renders in both workspace and print output. Biggest single impact — compositions went from floating objects on blank paper to scenes with depth and mood.

### Phase 2 — Element Library Expansion ✅
Added `scene-elements.js` with 11 new elements: bamboo grove, rock formation, temple roof, distant village, stone path, wooden bridge, rain curtain, snowfall, cloud wisp, maple branch, iris cluster. Total library grew from ~25 to ~36 elements across 4 files.

### Phase 3 — Procedural Variation ✅
Each element instance gets a `variationSeed` (mulberry32 PRNG) that subtly perturbs SVG paths, with amount scaling by carve level. Two copies of the same element now look slightly different — kills the digital copy-paste feel.

### Phase 4 — Scene Presets ✅
6 curated starting compositions accessible from the file menu: Mountain Dawn, Garden Pond, Ocean Night, Snow Village, Bamboo Forest, Autumn Valley. Each sets palette, atmosphere, paper type, and places elements with intentional carve levels and scales.

### Phase 5 — Ink Absorption ✅
Ink absorption variation in print engine post-processing — subtle per-region opacity variation so large inked areas don't look perfectly uniform, mimicking how paper absorbs ink unevenly.

### Phase 6 — Carving Experience ✅
Four features deepening the carving workflow:
- **Carve Focus Mode**: F key or Focus button zooms smoothly into a selected element with floating toolbar. Dimmed non-focused elements. Escape exits. Smooth viewBox animation.
- **Carve Pattern Fills**: 6 patterns (crosshatch, woodgrain, diagonal, stipple, wave) replace flat paper reveals on carved areas. Per-element `el.carvePattern`, renders in both workspace and print.
- **Background Carving**: Paper background is now carveable. Click empty space in carve mode to carve the paper itself. Strokes render between atmosphere and elements.
- **Hanko Stamps**: 6 pre-made seal shapes (circle, square, gourd, oval, diamond, cloud) + custom initials generator (1–3 characters → procedural brush-stroke seal). Hanko elements get reduced misregistration in print.

### Phase 7 — Carve Tool Naturalness ✅
Three tiers of pen input and rendering improvements:
- **Input smoothing**: EMA filter on position/pressure/tilt, coalesced pointer events for full digitizer resolution (~240Hz on Surface Pen).
- **Catmull-Rom curves**: Replaced polyline rendering (M L L L) with smooth cubic Bezier curves through all stroke points.
- **Variable-width pressure ribbons**: Per-point pressure maps to ribbon width via filled path outlines (not constant-width strokes). Entry/exit taper, organic noise.
- **Tilt-based gouge asymmetry**: Pen tilt shifts ribbon half-widths for calligraphic variation (V-gouge: 0.5, U-gouge: 0.35).
- **Pressure curve presets**: Soft/Medium/Firm configurable response curves in Carving Workbench.
- **Print fidelity**: Fiber ghosts in shallow cuts, ink edge pooling on deep cuts, pressure-dependent edge noise, tilt feathering on shallow wall side.

### Phase 8 — Paper Type Expansion ✅
Three new papers added (total: 6):
- **Gampi** (雁皮) — ultra-smooth, cool-toned, luminous. Cleanest prints.
- **Unryu** (雲龍) — dramatic long sweeping fibers via quadratic curves.
- **Kakishibu** (柿渋) — persimmon-tanned warm brown. Unique darker aesthetic.
Paper selector updated to 3-column grid. Print engine now uses actual paper base color for carve grooves (not hardcoded).

## Future Work

### Element Fidelity
- **Hand-crafted SVG replacements** — Current elements are procedural. Hand-drawn SVGs with hatching, texture lines, and form-following detail would dramatically raise visual quality. This is the single biggest remaining quality gap vs. what AI image generators produce.

### Composition & Creativity
- **Composition guides** — Rule-of-thirds, golden ratio, and horizon-line overlays to help users compose intentional scenes.
- **More scene presets** — Seasonal themes, time-of-day variations, genre-specific starters (seascape, garden, urban, spiritual).

### Platform & Polish
- **PWA** — manifest.json and service worker for installability and offline use.
- **Touch gestures** — Pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan for tablet use.
- **Responsive layout** — Panels adapt for desktop (side panel) vs tablet (bottom sheet) vs phone (modal panels).
- **Keyboard shortcuts expansion** — More shortcuts for power users.

### Print Engine
- **Advanced bokashi** — Multi-directional gradients, radial fades, more nuanced ink distribution.
- **Registration marks** — Visual guides showing block alignment for multi-color printing authenticity.
